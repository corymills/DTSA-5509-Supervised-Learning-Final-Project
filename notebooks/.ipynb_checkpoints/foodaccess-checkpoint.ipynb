    "### Project Topic\n",
    "Food Deserts are areas where there is low access to supermarkets and other sources of healthy foods. They are often reported as occuring in communities that are already underserved, low income, and in Black communities. Access to food that is affordable and healthy is critical to support the health and wellbeing of a community, and areas that are struggling with poverty and inequality often also struggle with basic access to healthy food.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the circumstances that create food deserts is critical in being able to identify and address the root causes of the problem. If we can model this, we can make connections in the data we may not have seen otherwise.  We can also use this to predict outcomes as communities change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using socio-economic data from the Department of Agriculture's Food Access Research Atlas, I explored three decision tree binary classification models to attempt to classify whether a community is likely to have low access to healthy food sources.\n",

    "### Data Cleaning\n",

    "As outlined above, I've limited the features used to the most relevant features for the classification task I wanted to perform.  Of the 147 features, 18 are relevant for the task of classifying the low food access status based on the demographic makeup of an area.  Many of the other features in the original file describe in detail the low food access for specific populations, so have been left out since they would be auto-correlative with the low access label I'm attempting to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, while reviewing the number of NA values present in the data, I found that `MedianFamilyIncome` had a high count of NAs. I have dropped this feature from the dataset for this reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "`OHU2010` has values of 0 for 106 rows. This appears to be null data, coded as 0.  As this will cause a division by 0 error when calculating percentages below, I'm also dropping these rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining features have a low number of NA values.  For these, I have dropped the rows that contained NA values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original dataset, the demographic data is reported as total counts of residents in that demographic. Because I want to compare tracts, and each tract may have a different total population, it makes most sense to convert these to percentages.  Below, I calculate the percentage of residents in each demographic using the demographic count and the total population count `Pop2010`.  After I've done these calculations, I drop the original count columns as they are no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also investigated whether the labels in the dataset were balanced.  I've found that they are not, and I rebalance these later while building the model."

    "For both the standard Decision Tree and AdaBoost, the ROC-AUC score was relatively low.  However, for the XGBoost model with both the Urban/Rural and Census Division features included, the ROC-AUC score was the highest.  For this reason, I would choose the XGBoost model that included the engineered features.  Even though this model is more complex than the one without the engineered features included, it did perform better than the one without."
