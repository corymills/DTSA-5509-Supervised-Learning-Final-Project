# DTSA 5509 Supervised Learning Final Project
## Decision Tree Binary Classification Tasks Applied to Food Access Research Atlas
### Project Topic
Food Deserts are areas where there is low access to supermarkets and other sources of healthy foods. They are often reported as occuring in communities that are already underserved, low income, and in Black communities. Access to food that is affordable and healthy is critical to support the health and wellbeing of a community, and areas that are struggling with poverty and inequality often also struggle with basic access to healthy food.

Understanding the circumstances that create food deserts is critical in being able to identify and address the root causes of the problem. If we can model this, we can make connections in the data we may not have seen otherwise.  We can also use this to predict outcomes as communities change.

Using socio-economic data from the Department of Agriculture's Food Access Research Atlas, I explored three decision tree binary classification models to attempt to classify whether a community is likely to have low access to healthy food sources.
